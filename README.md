# Timothy's Personal Webpage

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). The website is hosted and deployed on Vercel. The goal of this website is to display my skillset in web development, as well as learn and get more familiar with the full stack workflow.

You can find the webpage at [https://timchoy.vercel.app/](https://timchoy.vercel.app/).



## Planned Additions (TODO)

- Create the projects page, and populate it
    - Connect the project to a database, and use that to store the list of projects
